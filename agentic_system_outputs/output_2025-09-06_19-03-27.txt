internal_response: Steps executed:
1) Generated financial report as of 2025-04-05 to confirm inventory context and cash status.
2) Recorded the customer request details (500 sheets Cardstock, 250 sheets A4 paper, delivery by 2025-04-15, request date 2025-04-05).
3) Retrieved delivery address: manlok ganupe, 3738 cochrane ave., Missisauga, Quebec, M6X9V1.
4) Checked inventory with Inventory Manager: Cardstock on-hand = 595 units; A4 paper on-hand = 772 units (as of 2025-04-05). Both are sufficient to fulfill requested quantities; inventory does not explicitly state whether the Cardstock is “high-quality, recycled” or available in multiple colors (attribute missing from inventory record).
5) Determined stock needs: no stock_order required (needed quantities = 0 for both items).
6) Requested pricing from Quoting Manager and used unit prices from inventory summary (Cardstock $0.15/unit, A4 paper $0.05/unit). Assumed no price adjustment for the “high-quality, recycled” attribute since no differential pricing information was available.
7) Confirmed delivery timing and placed the sales order with Ordering Manager. Both items can be shipped from stock and scheduled to arrive well before the requested date (system ETA for shipment from stock: 2025-04-07, satisfying the 2025-04-15 requirement). Ordering Manager recorded sales transactions: Cardstock 500 units (Transaction ID 34), A4 paper 250 units (Transaction ID 35). No supplier stock_order was required.
8) Pricing and tax calculation used for the sale: Cardstock 500 × $0.15 = $75.00 (pre-tax); A4 paper 250 × $0.05 = $12.50 (pre-tax). Subtotal (pre-tax) = $87.50. HST 13% = $11.38. Total (including HST) = $98.88. Shipping cost = $0.00 (no charge).
9) Rendered final status: Order placed and recorded, items reserved and scheduled for delivery to the provided address. Note: Inventory does not explicitly confirm the Cardstock’s recycled/high-quality certification or color availability — I used the Cardstock SKU we carry to fulfill the order. If you require explicit recycled certification or specific colors, we can review alternatives but that may impact availability/pricing.

Actions taken (summary): financial report generated; customer request recorded; delivery address retrieved; inventory checked and confirmed sufficient; no stock order required; quote prepared; order placed and transactions recorded (IDs 34 & 35); delivery scheduled to meet requested date.
