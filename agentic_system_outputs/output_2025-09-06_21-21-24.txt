internal_response: Actions performed (per required orchestration plan):
1) Generated financial report for 2025-04-12 and recorded relevant inventory snapshot.
2) Recorded the customer request and extracted details: request date 2025-04-12; desired delivery 2025-04-15; items: 10,000 A4 white sheets, 5,000 A3 colored sheets (assorted), 500 reams of cardboard (assumed 500 sheets/ream). Mapped internal item names: A4 paper, Colored paper, Cardstock.
3) Retrieved delivery address: Manlok Stone, 6174 trudeau rd., Toronto, Ontario, T8T8G3.
4) Checked inventory with Inventory Manager: current stock (as of 2025-04-12): A4 paper 5,000 sheets; Colored paper 188 sheets; Cardstock 0. Calculated shortfalls: A4 need 5,000; Colored need 4,812; Cardstock need 500 reams (250,000 sheets assuming 500 sheets/ream).
5) Determined stock needs for replenishment and requested quantities to supplier (A4 5,000, Colored 4,812, Cardstock 250,000 sheets/500 reams).
6) Obtained customer pricing assumptions from Quoting Manager (market-based assumptions with markup): A4 = CAD 0.0150/sheet; A3 colored = CAD 0.0500/sheet; Cardboard ream (500 sheets) = CAD 31.25/ream. Computed customer-facing quote totals (see breakdown below).
7) Checked delivery timing and placed orders with Ordering Manager:
   - Placed customer sales orders for on-hand/viable quantities that meet the requested delivery date:
     * A4 paper — 5,000 sheets sold (Sale ID 85) — scheduled to deliver by 2025-04-15.
     * A3 colored — 188 sheets sold (Sale ID 87) — scheduled to deliver by 2025-04-14.
   - Created supplier stock_orders for the outstanding A4 (5,000 sheets, Stock Order ID 86) and Colored (4,812 sheets, Stock Order ID 88). Supplier ETA for stock_orders is 2025-04-19; estimated customer delivery if those supplier shipments are used is 2025-04-22 (after requested date).
   - Attempted to create supplier stock_order for Cardstock (500 reams / 250,000 sheets) but this was blocked because supplier pricing for that large Cardstock order is missing in the system; no Cardstock stock_order or sale record was created.
8) Final determination of viability for requested delivery (2025-04-15):
   - Viable (can be delivered by requested date from on-hand stock): A4 — 5,000 sheets (sale placed), A3 colored — 188 sheets (sale placed).
   - Not viable for requested date (require supplier replenishment that arrives after requested date): remaining A4 5,000 sheets and remaining A3 colored 4,812 sheets (supplier ETA 2025-04-19; customer ETA ~2025-04-22).
   - Cannot be ordered at this time for supplier fulfillment: Cardstock (500 reams) — blocked due to missing supplier price; no stock_order created.
9) Recorded transaction references and notes:
   - A4 sale (on-hand shipped): Sale ID 85
   - A4 stock_order (to supplier for remaining 5,000): Stock Order ID 86 (supplier ETA 2025-04-19)
   - A3 colored sale (on-hand shipped): Sale ID 87
   - A3 colored stock_order (to supplier for remaining 4,812): Stock Order ID 88 (supplier ETA 2025-04-19)
   - Cardstock (500 reams): No stock_order created due to missing supplier price; supplier quote required to proceed.
10) Pricing applied to customer sales (HST 13% applies to customer sales only). Supplier stock_orders are tax-inclusive at supplier side and not taxed again here.

Summary of quoted prices (customer-facing, pre-tax):
- A4 paper: CAD 0.0150 per sheet
- A3 colored paper: CAD 0.0500 per sheet
- Cardboard ream (500 sheets): CAD 31.25 per ream

Full-order customer quote (if all items were available):
- A4 (10,000 sheets × 0.0150) = CAD 150.00
- A3 colored (5,000 sheets × 0.0500) = CAD 250.00
- Cardboard (500 reams × 31.25) = CAD 15,625.00
- Subtotal (before tax) = CAD 16,025.00
- HST (13%) = CAD 2,083.25
- Total (including tax) = CAD 18,108.25

Confirmed sales (placed now — meet 2025-04-15):
- A4: 5,000 sheets sold — CAD 75.00 (pre-tax)
- A3 colored: 188 sheets sold — CAD 9.40 (pre-tax)
- Subtotal (before tax) = CAD 84.40
- HST (13%) = CAD 10.97
- Total (including tax) = CAD 95.37

Notes/Blockers: Cardstock for signage (500 reams) could not be ordered because supplier pricing is missing/uncertain for that large quantity. We can proceed to order Cardstock as soon as a supplier price is obtained/confirmed; supplier ETA in past checks was ~2025-04-19, with customer delivery ~2025-04-22 (therefore not on time for 2025-04-15).

Next actions required from customer (per ordering decision policy):
Because one or more items cannot be delivered by your requested date, we have placed the order for viable on-hand items (above) and need your instruction on how to handle the delayed/outstanding items (remaining A4, remaining A3 colored, and Cardstock). Please choose one of the following options:
  a) Cancel this order entirely (we will cancel the sales/orders already placed).
  b) Complete the order for the delayed items as well (we will order the remaining quantities and ship everything together when all items arrive — note estimated customer ETA ~2025-04-22 for supplier shipments).
  c) Cancel the delayed item(s) only (proceed with the confirmed on-hand shipment and cancel any supplier orders or pending supplier orders for delayed items).  

If you choose b) to complete the full order including delayed items, note specifically that Cardstock cannot be ordered until we obtain a supplier price; we will request supplier pricing immediately upon your go-ahead and then place the Cardstock stock_order. If you prefer, we can cancel Cardstock only (option c).

All actions and records are logged. Sales and stock_order IDs are provided above. Delivery address used: Manlok Stone, 6174 trudeau rd., Toronto, Ontario, T8T8G3. Shipping cost: CAD 0.00.

If you reply with your choice (a, b, or c), we will execute it immediately (cancel or place remaining orders).
 response_to_client: Thank you — I have started processing your order for the April 15, 2025 delivery request and completed sales for items we could deliver from stock today. Summary and next steps:

What I placed for immediate delivery (meets your Apr 15 deadline):
- A4 white paper — 5,000 sheets (on-hand) — Sale ID 85 — Unit price CAD 0.0150/sheet — Pre-tax CAD 75.00
- A3 colored paper — 188 sheets (on-hand) — Sale ID 87 — Unit price CAD 0.0500/sheet — Pre-tax CAD 9.40
- Subtotal (on-hand items) = CAD 84.40
- HST (13%) = CAD 10.97
- Total = CAD 95.37
Delivery: A3 colored on-hand scheduled to arrive by 2025-04-14; A4 on-hand scheduled to arrive by 2025-04-15. Shipping cost is CAD 0.00.

Outstanding items (cannot be delivered by Apr 15 without supplier replenishment):
- Remaining A4: 5,000 sheets (stock_order placed — Stock Order ID 86). Supplier ETA: 2025-04-19; estimated delivery to you ~2025-04-22.
- Remaining A3 colored: 4,812 sheets (stock_order placed — Stock Order ID 88). Supplier ETA: 2025-04-19; estimated delivery to you ~2025-04-22.
- Cardstock (cardboard for signage): 500 reams (assumed 500 sheets/ream). We could not create the supplier order for this item because a supplier price for this quantity is not available in our system — therefore no stock_order was created and Cardstock is currently not ordered.

Full-order customer quote (for reference, if you want everything fulfilled):
- A4 (10,000 sheets): CAD 150.00 (pre-tax)
- A3 colored (5,000 sheets): CAD 250.00 (pre-tax)
- Cardboard (500 reams): CAD 15,625.00 (pre-tax) — NOTE: supplier price for this item still needs confirmation before we can place the supplier order
- Subtotal (pre-tax): CAD 16,025.00
- HST (13%): CAD 2,083.25
- Total: CAD 18,108.25

Important: Because Cardstock cannot currently be ordered (no supplier price on file), we need your instruction on how to proceed. Please choose one of the following options and reply with your choice:
  a) Cancel this order entirely (I will cancel the sales/orders already placed).
  b) Complete the order for the delayed items as well — I will obtain the supplier price for Cardstock and proceed to order the remaining A4 and A3 colored from supplier; all items would ship together when the delayed items arrive (estimated customer delivery ~2025-04-22).
  c) Cancel the delayed item(s) only — proceed with the confirmed on-hand shipment (the CAD 95.37 order) and cancel Cardstock and any remaining supplier orders for delayed quantities.

If you choose b), I will immediately request supplier pricing for the Cardstock (500 reams) and place the supplier order once price is confirmed; stock_order ETA from suppliers is currently estimated at 2025-04-19 with customer delivery ~2025-04-22 (so this misses your Apr 15 date). If you choose a) I will cancel all current records (sales and stock orders). If you choose c) I will leave the confirmed on-hand shipment in place and cancel pending supplier orders for delayed items.

Delivery address used: Manlok Stone, 6174 trudeau rd., Toronto, Ontario, T8T8G3.

Please reply with your choice (a, b, or c) and I will execute it immediately. If you prefer, I can proceed with option b) and simultaneously attempt to expedite supplier shipments, but expedited delivery is not guaranteed by suppliers.

Thank you — your on-hand items are already booked and will be delivered by Apr 15 as requested.
