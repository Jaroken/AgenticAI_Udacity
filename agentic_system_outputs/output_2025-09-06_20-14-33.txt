- Because the supplier ETA for the remaining items is 2025-04-12, we cannot deliver the full original request by 2025-04-10. We have fulfilled and shipped all on-hand inventory that meets the deadline.

Next steps required from customer (delivery decision due to partial delay):
Please choose one of the following options so we can finalize handling of the delayed items:
 a) Cancel this order entirely (we will cancel the in-stock sales orders and the stock_orders).
 b) Complete the order for the delayed items as well and ship all at once (we will hold or cancel the in-stock shipment and instead ship everything together once the stock_orders arrive, estimated combined shipment date 2025-04-12).
 c) Cancel the delayed items only (accept the in-stock shipment that is already placed and shipped; cancel the stock_orders for the remaining quantities).

If you confirm which option you prefer, we will proceed immediately. 
 response_to_client: Hello Evelyn —

Thanks — I processed your request to order 500 sheets of A4 printing paper and 200 sheets of cardstock (request date 2025-04-08, desired delivery 2025-04-10). Here’s what I did and what to expect:

What I shipped now (to meet your April 10 deadline):
- 222 sheets A4 paper (sale ID 60) — shipped 2025-04-08
- 5 sheets Cardstock (sale ID 61) — shipped 2025-04-08
Shipping address on file: Evelyn Yip, 8098 Lakeside St., Toronto, ON, X6V0C6
Shipping cost: $0.00 (no cost)

What we ordered from the supplier (shortfalls):
- 278 sheets A4 paper (stock_order ID 58) — ETA 2025-04-12
- 195 sheets Cardstock (stock_order ID 59) — ETA 2025-04-12

Pricing (all amounts in CAD):
Full order (500 A4 + 200 Cardstock): subtotal $55.00; HST 13% = $7.15; total = $62.15
In-stock portion shipped now: subtotal $11.85; HST = $1.54; total = $13.39
Remaining portion on order (ETA 2025-04-12): subtotal $43.15; HST = $5.61; total = $48.76

Because the supplier ETA for the remaining items is 2025-04-12, the full requested quantity cannot arrive by 2025-04-10. I have therefore shipped all on-hand items now to meet your deadline and created stock orders for the remainder.

Please tell me which of the following you’d like to do for the delayed items:
 a) Cancel this order entirely (we will cancel the in-stock shipments and stock orders).
 b) Complete the order for the delayed items as well and ship all at once (we will hold/recall the in-stock shipment and ship everything together when stock arrives, estimated combined shipment date 2025-04-12).
 c) Cancel the delayed items only (keep the in-stock shipment that is already placed and do not fulfill the remaining stock_orders).

Reply with option a, b, or c and I will take care of it right away. If I don’t hear back, the in-stock items will be delivered as scheduled (sale IDs 60 and 61) and the remaining items will arrive separately when supplier stock arrives (ETA 2025-04-12; stock_order IDs 58 & 59). 

Thanks — I’ll await your choice and will proceed immediately once you confirm.
