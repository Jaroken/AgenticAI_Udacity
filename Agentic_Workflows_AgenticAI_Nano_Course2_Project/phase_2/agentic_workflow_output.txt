 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The feature "Documenting the code and features for future reference" can be broken down into several user stories that can be organized into cohesive groups. Some user stories could include:

1. As a developer, I want to be able to add comments to the code to explain its functionality.
2. As a developer, I want to create detailed documentation for each feature to aid in future maintenance.
3. As a user, I want to access user-friendly documentation to understand how to use the product.
4. As a product manager, I want to ensure that all code changes are documented to track the evolution of the product.
5. As a team member, I want to easily search and find relevant documentation for specific features.

These user stories can be grouped together under the feature "Documenting the code and features for future reference" to ensure that all aspects of documentation are considered and implemented effectively.
