 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
One way to organize user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback could be to group them under a feature called "Continuous Improvement." This feature could include user stories such as analyzing user feedback, identifying areas for enhancement, prioritizing changes based on feedback, implementing improvements, and testing changes before deployment. By organizing these user stories under the "Continuous Improvement" feature, it helps ensure that all related tasks are grouped together and can be easily managed and tracked as a cohesive unit.

The original prompt was: One way to organize user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback could be to group them under a feature called "Continuous Improvement." This feature could include user stories such as analyzing user feedback, identifying areas for enhancement, prioritizing changes based on feedback, implementing improvements, and testing changes before deployment. By organizing these user stories under the "Continuous Improvement" feature, it helps ensure that all related tasks are grouped together and can be easily managed and tracked as a cohesive unit.
The response to that prompt was: By organizing user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback under the "Continuous Improvement" feature, it allows for a cohesive approach to managing tasks related to analyzing feedback, identifying areas for enhancement, prioritizing changes, implementing improvements, and testing changes. This grouping helps in tracking progress and ensuring that all tasks related to continuous improvement are managed efficiently and effectively.
It has been evaluated as incorrect.
Make only these corrections, do not alter content validity: To fix the answer, ensure it follows the correct structure: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Reframe the response to align with this structure by clearly stating the user type, the desired action or feature, and the benefit/value it provides. Avoid discussing the benefits of organizing user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback under the "Continuous Improvement" feature.
Worker Agent Response:
As a product manager, I want to organize user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback under the "Continuous Improvement" feature so that tasks related to analyzing feedback, identifying areas for enhancement, prioritizing changes, implementing improvements, and testing changes can be managed efficiently and effectively.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer does not meet the criteria. The structure for user stories should be "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." The provided answer does not follow this structure as it starts with "As a product manager, I want to organize user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback under the 'Continuous Improvement' feature..."
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, restructure it following the correct format for user stories: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Start the user story with the user type, followed by the action or feature they desire, and then the benefit or value they seek. For example, "As a product manager, I want to easily organize user stories related to iterating on the product based on feedback under the 'Continuous Improvement' feature so that I can efficiently track and prioritize enhancements based on user input."
