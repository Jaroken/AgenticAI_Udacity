- Checked inventory with Inventory Manager: mapped customer items to internal SKUs Glossy paper, 100 lb cover stock (for heavy cardstock), and Colored paper. Current on-hand (2025-04-01): Glossy paper 587 sheets, 100 lb cover stock 636 sheets, Colored paper 788 sheets. Unit = sheets.

Notes:
- The system did not have a distinct “A4 glossy” SKU; we fulfilled the request using our Glossy paper stock to meet the A4 glossy requirement as requested and have recorded the order accordingly. If you need a different specification for the glossy sheets (e.g., a particular A4 glossy brand or weight), reply and we can advise alternatives, but this is not required to fulfill the current order.
