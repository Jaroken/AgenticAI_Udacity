internal_response: I executed the required orchestration steps for the customer request dated 2025-04-15. Actions performed and results:

1) Generated financial report as of 2025-04-15: cash balance $45,707.95; inventory valuation $5,601.75. Key inventory snapshot items relevant to this order: “A4 paper” shows -14,500 (negative) in the snapshot, “Glossy paper” shows 0, and “Cardstock” shows 9,500 available.

2) Recorded the customer email details and parsed the request: 2000 A4 glossy sheets, 1500 A3 matte sheets, 1000 cardstock assorted colors, delivery requested by 2025-04-20.

3) Retrieved delivery address: Attention: rose singh, 4649 yonge ave., Paris, Manitoba, Canada, H0G0S8.

4) Called Inventory Manager: confirmed Cardstock SKU exists with 9,500 units in stock. No exact internal SKUs for the requested names “A4 glossy paper” and “A3 matte paper” were present in the snapshot; closest internal matches suggested were Glossy/Photo paper and 80 lb text/100 lb cover as matte proxies. Inventory manager recommended mapping the requested items to internal SKUs for ordering.

5) Called determine_stock_needs: system identified needed stock: Glossy paper 2,000; A4 paper 16,000 (note: this is a system-derived need based on internal mappings); Cardstock need: 0 (in-stock sufficient).

6) Called Quoting Manager: set customer unit prices using internal price mappings and computed the quote (sale to customer). Pricing used:
   - A4 glossy (mapped to Glossy paper): unit price $0.20/sheet -> line subtotal $400.00
   - A3 matte (matte proxy mapped to 80 lb text paper): unit price $0.40/sheet -> line subtotal $600.00
   - Cardstock assorted colors: unit price $0.15/sheet -> line subtotal $150.00
   Quote subtotal (before tax): $1,150.00. HST (13%): $149.50. Grand total (including HST): $1,299.50. Shipping cost: $0.00.

7) Called Ordering Manager to check delivery timing and place orders for viable items. Ordering Manager report and actions:
   - Cardstock (1000 sheets): in stock (9,500 available). Stock reserved/allocated 1,000 units. Customer ETA confirmed: 2025-04-17 (meets requested 2025-04-20). Transaction created: Sales Transaction ID 151. Line total (incl HST): $169.50.
   - Glossy paper (2000 sheets, mapped SKU ‘Glossy paper’): inventory snapshot had 0; supplier/customer lead time indicates supplier ETA to Beaver’s Choice 2025-04-22 and customer ETA 2025-04-25. Transaction created: Sales Transaction ID 149. Line total (incl HST): $452.00. Earliest deliverable date to customer: 2025-04-25 (cannot meet 2025-04-20).
   - A3 matte (1500 sheets, mapped to 80 lb text paper as matte proxy): supplier ETA to Beaver’s Choice 2025-04-22 and customer ETA 2025-04-25. Transaction created: Sales Transaction ID 150. Line total (incl HST): $678.00. Earliest deliverable date to customer: 2025-04-25 (cannot meet 2025-04-20).

   Notes: Ordering Manager created sales records for all three lines and reserved Cardstock from stock. However, Glossy and A3 matte lines cannot be delivered by the requested date due to supplier lead times (earliest 2025-04-25). No stock_order was created because sales records were created; Cardstock fulfilled from existing inventory.

8) Determined viable items relative to requested delivery date (2025-04-20):
   - Viable (can be delivered by 2025-04-20): Cardstock (1000 sheets) — confirmed delivery 2025-04-17.
   - Not viable (cannot be delivered by 2025-04-20): A4 glossy (2000) and A3 matte (1500) — earliest customer delivery 2025-04-25.

9) Placed/recorded sales transactions and returned order references:
   - Transaction 151: Cardstock — 1000 sheets — reserved — customer ETA 2025-04-17 — line total $169.50 (incl HST).
   - Transaction 149: Glossy paper (A4 glossy mapping) — 2000 sheets — customer ETA 2025-04-25 — line total $452.00 (incl HST).
   - Transaction 150: A3 matte (matte proxy mapping) — 1500 sheets — customer ETA 2025-04-25 — line total $678.00 (incl HST).

10) Pricing summary (customer-facing):
   - Subtotal (before tax): $1,150.00
   - HST (13%): $149.50
   - Grand total (including HST): $1,299.50
   - Shipping: $0.00

11) Decision and next action per policy: Because one or more items cannot be delivered by the requested date, I have reserved and placed the order for the viable item (Cardstock). Sales records for the delayed items have been created and flagged with their earliest deliverable date (2025-04-25). Per policy, please choose one of the following options so I can proceed:
   a) Cancel this order entirely (I will cancel all three sales transactions and release reserved stock),
   b) Complete the order for the delayed items as well and ship all items together when the delayed items are available (combined shipment earliest 2025-04-25),
   c) Cancel the delayed items only (keep the Cardstock order that will be delivered 2025-04-17).

Blockers/notes: internal SKU name mismatches for A4 glossy and A3 matte were resolved with proxy SKUs for ordering. If you prefer a different SKU or an expedited option to meet 2025-04-20 for the delayed items, we can check alternate stock or expedite options (expedited handling may or may not be available).
