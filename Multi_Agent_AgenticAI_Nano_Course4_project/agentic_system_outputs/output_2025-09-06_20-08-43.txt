internal_response: Completed orchestration steps for customer order dated 2025-04-07 requesting delivery by 2025-04-10.

Actions taken (step-by-step):
1) Generated financial report for 2025-04-07.
2) Recorded the customer request details (items, quantities, desired delivery date).
3) Retrieved delivery address: Rose Parker, 3313 maple cres., Paris, Quebec, Z5Z0P3, Canada.
4) Called Inventory Manager: current stock levels as of 2025-04-07 — A4 paper: 222 sheets; A3 glossy: 0 sheets; Kraft paper: 493 units (unit not explicitly defined in feed).
5) Determined stock needs: only Glossy paper requires a stock_order of 100 sheets.
6) Called Quoting Manager and set customer pricing (used standard unit prices): A4 paper $0.05/sheet; A3 glossy $0.20/sheet; Kraft envelopes $0.10/packet. Computed per-item totals and subtotal.
7) Checked delivery timing with Ordering Manager: A4 (in-stock) and Kraft (stock level sufficient assuming units align to packets) can be delivered by 2025-04-10 from current stock. Supplier restock ETA for 100 A3 glossy sheets is 2025-04-08, which supports delivery by 2025-04-10.
8) Placed orders and recorded the sale (sales order and stock_order created):
   - A4 paper: 200 sheets fulfilled from stock (inventory reduces from 222 to 22).
   - Kraft envelopes: 50 packets fulfilled from stock (inventory reduces accordingly from 493 to 443, assuming units align as packets).
   - A3 glossy paper: created a stock_order for 100 sheets from supplier (supplier ETA 2025-04-08). Once received into inventory, this item will be shipped to meet the requested delivery date.
9) Pricing and invoice details prepared and recorded.

Notes / Assumptions / Constraints:
- Inventory feed did not explicitly state whether the reported Kraft paper units are packets; Inventory Manager indicated the unit was not specified. I assumed the stock units align with the customer's requested 50 packets and proceeded to fulfill from stock. If internal stock unit does not equal packets, we will adjust and notify you if this affects fulfillment.
- Supplier charges/taxes on the stock_order are handled on our supplier side. For the customer invoice I have broken down price before tax, the HST (13%), and total below.
- Shipping has no cost to the customer or supplier.

Pricing breakdown (customer invoice):
- A4 white printer paper: 200 sheets × $0.05 = $10.00
- A3 glossy paper: 100 sheets × $0.20 = $20.00
- 100% recycled kraft paper envelopes: 50 packets × $0.10 = $5.00
Subtotal (before HST): $35.00
HST (13%): $4.55
Total: $39.55

Delivery: All items are scheduled to arrive on or before April 10, 2025. The supplier restock for the A3 glossy is expected on April 8, 2025, allowing us to include that item in the shipment and meet your requested date. Delivery address used: Rose Parker, 3313 maple cres., Paris, Quebec, Z5Z0P3.

Records created: Customer request recorded, sales order and stock_order created in ordering system, pricing recorded by quoting manager, inventory updated for fulfilled items pending physical pick/pack.

If any internal discrepancy appears regarding the Kraft unit definition, operations will correct inventory and update the order internally; customer-facing delivery and the invoice total will not change without notifying you if a material issue arises.
