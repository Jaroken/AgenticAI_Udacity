internal_response: I executed the full orchestration for Evelyn Stone’s order request dated 2025-04-14 (requested delivery 2025-04-15). Actions performed (in order):

1) Generated the company financial snapshot as of 2025-04-14 to anchor the state.  
2) Recorded the customer request details (items requested, quantities, request date, desired delivery date).  
3) Retrieved delivery address: Evelyn Stone, 4021 Lockridge St., Paris, British Columbia, Canada, F6E6E1.  
4) Checked inventory with the Inventory Manager for the internal items mapped from the customer terms: Cardstock, A4 paper, and Colored paper. Current stock (sheets): Cardstock = 0; A4 paper = 4,500; Colored paper = 4,612.  
5) Determined stock needs: Cardstock requires a stock_order of 500 sheets; A4 and Colored have sufficient stock for the requested quantities.  
6) Obtained pricing guidance from the Quoting Manager (used available valuation/pricing state): unit prices used for customer quoting: Cardstock $0.15/sheet; A4 paper $0.05/sheet; Colored paper $0.10/sheet. Using those prices I computed line totals and order-level totals (see breakdown below). Note: supplier stock_orders have no tax.  
7) Checked delivery timing with the Ordering Manager and retrieved ETAs: with current processing timelines the earliest deliveries are: A4 paper (1000) — customer delivery ETA 2025-04-16; Colored paper (200) — customer delivery ETA 2025-04-16. Supplier ETA to restock Cardstock (500) — 2025-04-18; projected customer delivery for Cardstock if shipped after receipt — ~2025-04-20.  
8) Reasoning about delivery date (requested 2025-04-15): none of the requested items can be delivered on or before 2025-04-15. A4 and Colored would arrive one day late (2025-04-16); Cardstock would arrive considerably later (supplier restock 2025-04-18, customer delivery ~2025-04-20).  
9) Ordering decision & actions taken: Because one or more items cannot be delivered by the requested date, and because no items are viable to meet 2025-04-15, I did NOT create a sales order to meet the original date (no items can be delivered on-time). I prepared the options and am ready to create transactions when you instruct which option to proceed with. The Ordering Manager prepared placeholders and ETAs, but no sales_order or supplier stock_order IDs were created since the customer’s decision is required.  

Pricing breakdown (before tax, tax, and totals):
- Cardstock (high-quality white) 500 sheets @ $0.15/sheet = $75.00  (supplier stock_order — no tax on supplier order)
- A4 paper (standard printing) 1000 sheets @ $0.05/sheet = $50.00
- Colored paper (assorted) 200 sheets @ $0.10/sheet = $20.00
Full-order subtotal (all items) = $145.00
HST (13%) on customer-chargeable items (A4 + Colored + Cardstock if shipped to customer) = $18.85
Full-order total (including HST) = $163.85

Available-items-only (A4 + Colored) pricing (if Cardstock is excluded or backordered separately):
- Subtotal (A4 + Colored) = $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00
- HST (13%) = $9.10
- Total (A4 + Colored) = $79.10

ETAs and delivery implications:
- Requested delivery date: 2025-04-15 (cannot be met)
- A4 paper (1000) — available in stock; earliest customer delivery: 2025-04-16
- Colored paper (200) — available in stock; earliest customer delivery: 2025-04-16
- Cardstock (500) — out of stock; supplier ETA 2025-04-18; if ordered and then shipped to customer, expected customer delivery ~2025-04-20

Next-step readiness: I am ready to take action once you select one of the options below. When you choose, I will create the sales order and/or the supplier stock_order and record the transactions. If you choose to proceed with shipping available items only, I will create the sales order immediately to ship A4 (1000) + Colored (200) for delivery ~2025-04-16 and collect tax as shown. If you choose to wait for Cardstock and ship all at once, I will place a supplier stock_order for 500 Cardstock sheets (no tax) and hold shipment until the Cardstock arrives, then create the sales order to ship all items together (customer ETA for all items would be ~2025-04-20). If you choose to cancel the order entirely I will cancel and not create any orders.  

No transactions have been created yet; I am awaiting your choice. If you confirm the option to proceed I will record and return the sales order ID and/or supplier stock_order ID and final invoice details.
 response_to_client: Thank you — I reviewed your request for delivery by April 15, 2025 (request dated 2025-04-14). Summary of findings and immediate options:

What I checked:
- Delivery address: Evelyn Stone, 4021 Lockridge St., Paris, BC F6E6E1
- Inventory: Cardstock = 0 sheets; A4 paper = 4,500 sheets; Colored paper = 4,612 sheets
- ETAs: A4 and Colored can be shipped from stock and would arrive 2025-04-16 (one day later than requested). Cardstock needs a supplier stock order (supplier ETA 2025-04-18; customer delivery would be ~2025-04-20).

Because none of the items can be delivered by your requested date (2025-04-15), I did not place any orders yet. I prepared pricing and am ready to act based on your preference. Price breakdown (before tax / tax / total):
- Cardstock (500 sheets @ $0.15) = $75.00  (supplier order — no tax on supplier order)
- A4 paper (1000 sheets @ $0.05) = $50.00
- Colored paper (200 sheets @ $0.10) = $20.00
Full-order subtotal = $145.00
HST (13%) = $18.85
Full-order total = $163.85

If you want only the items we can ship from stock now (A4 + Colored):
- Subtotal = $70.00
- HST (13%) = $9.10
- Total = $79.10
- Estimated delivery for those items: 2025-04-16

Please tell me which option you prefer (reply with the letter):
A) Cancel this order entirely (no orders placed). 
B) Complete the order for the delayed item as well and ship all at once — I will place a supplier stock_order for 500 Cardstock sheets (supplier ETA 2025-04-18) and hold shipment; estimated customer delivery for all items together ~2025-04-20. (No tax on the supplier stock_order; full customer invoice will use the amounts above once shipment is created.)
C) Cancel the delayed item only (Cardstock) and proceed to place the sales order now for A4 (1000) + Colored (200) to ship from stock — estimated delivery 2025-04-16. Total for those items = $79.10 (includes HST 13%).

If you pick B or C I will immediately create the necessary records and return the sales order and/or supplier stock_order IDs and the final invoice. If you prefer another approach (for example, expedited supplier shipping) I can check expedited options, but that may affect ETAs. Please reply with A, B, or C and I will proceed. Thank you.
